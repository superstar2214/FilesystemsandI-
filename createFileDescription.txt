The `createfile` command is used for creating new files in the current working directory. The syntax for the command is as follows:
`createfile <filename> [initialContent]`
- `<filename>`: The name of the file to be created. It must be a valid file name and should not already exist in the directory.
- `[initialContent]` (optional): The initial text content to be written into the newly created file.

Example Usage:
`createfile example.txt "This is initial content"`

When executed, the `createfile` command will create a new file with the specified name and write the optional initial content into it. If a file with the same name already exists, an error message will be displayed.
